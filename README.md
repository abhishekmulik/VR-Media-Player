Assuming that you have Node 12 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```npm install -g expo-cli```
Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

```expo init AwesomeProject```

```cd AwesomeProject```
```npm start``` # you can also use: expo start
This will start a development server for you.

Running your React Native application
Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the Camera app.

Modifying your app
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it. Open App.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines. The application should reload automatically once you save your changes.

That's it!
Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
